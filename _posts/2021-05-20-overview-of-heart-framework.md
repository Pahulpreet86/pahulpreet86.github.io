The **HEART Framework** was designed by Google to focus on only a few primary user metrics and to quantify those metrics to evaluate them critically.


**Need for the Framework**
-   Evaluation of customer engagement on a wide scale becomes a non-rival challenge as more products and services are deployed on the web.
-   User-centered metrics for web applications are necessary to track the progress and direct the product decisions.

## HEART Framework

**H - Happiness**
    

-   Describes metrics attitudinal in nature.
    
-   Relate to subjective aspect of user experience such as
    
	-   User Satisfaction
	    
	-   Visual Appeal
	    
	-   Likelihood to Recommend
	    
	-   Perceived Ease of Use
    
**E - Engagement**
    

-   Describes the level of Engagement with the product / feature.
    
-   Metrics refers to
	    

	-   Frequency
	    
	-   Intensity
	    
	-   Depth of Interaction (over period of time)
	    

-   Generally reported as an average, ratios or percentages.
    

**A - Adoption**
    

-   Describe the use of product / feature by the new user during a period of time.
    
-   Definition of use can change based on the nature of the goals, such as
    
	
	-   Visiting the feature page
	    
	-   Completion of a specific task
    
**R - Retention**
    

-   Describe the use of product / feature by the users of a given period still present in some later period.
    
-   Can be measured over different periods of time such as
    
	
	-   Week to Week
	    
	-   Monthly
	    
	-   90 Day Period

**T - Task Success**

    

-   Describe traditional metrics of user experience such as efficiency, effectiveness, and error rate.
    
-   If an optimal path exists for a particular task, it is possible to measure how closely users follow it.
    

## Goals - Signals - Metrics Process

**Goals**
    

-   Articulating the goals of the product / feature.
    
-   Every user centered metric is attached to the goal and can be used to track the progress for the same.
    
-   This step includes:
    
	
	-   Identify goals of product / feature.
	    
	-   Identify what users need to accomplish.
	    
	-   What redesign is trying to achieve.
	    
	-   Use of HEART Framework for articulation.
    

**Signals**
    

-   Identifying signals that indicate the success of the goals.
    
-   Translate the success / failure of goals in terms of user behaviour or attitude, and identify:
    
	
	-   Attitudinal / Behaviour signals.
	    
	-   Signals that are sensitive and specific to the goals.
    

**Metrics**
    

-   Building specific metrics to track on the dashboard.
    
-   Translate signals into metrics for tracking over time, and ensuring:
	    

	-   Use of stable metrics over time such as averages, ratios, and percentages
	    
	-   Accuracy of metrics based on application / web logs.
	    
	-   Additional metrics than the standard set for allowing products comparison with others such as competitors or within products.
