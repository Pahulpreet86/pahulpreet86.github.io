**Proof of Principle / Proof of Concept (POC)**: is an approach widely used in companies, before going forward with development, to determine feasibility of a concept for project or potential product.

  

The **Proof of Concept (POC) template** is used to evaluate the business value of an idea or concept presented, recognise potential challenges, gain insights from peers, and provide stakeholders with demonstration of the idea and rationalization to move forward.

  

**Proof of Concept Template**

  

-   **Product Rationale** - Involves specifying the target market, the customers’ pain points and the requirement of the product that can alleviate them.
    

  

-   **Solution Ideation** - Involves conceptualising the right solution  for addressing the customers’ pain points, which are both technologically feasible and within assigned business resources to expend.
    

  

-   **Prototype Design & Test** - Creation of prototype based on the finalised requirements, features, and feasible solution.This also includes continuous testing of the solution along implementation to make sure it really addresses the pain points shared by the customers.
    

  

-   **Document Results and Feedback** - The prototype is tested by the sample community of the target market and their experience, responses and other important information for the product are recorded. This feedback helps to verify the usability and feasibility of the product and suggest any possible changes to the proposed solution.
    

  

-   **POC Presentation** - Involves creation of presentation of the tested and improved product based on feedback for the stakeholders. The presentation covers the pain points that the product solves, features that address those problems, and technologies integrated to demonstrate the solution.
